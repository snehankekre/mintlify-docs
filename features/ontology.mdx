# Ontology

AstroBee's AI agent automatically builds and maintains your data ontology, understanding the relationships, context, and business meaning behind your enterprise data. No more manual schema mapping or complex data modeling - let AI do the heavy lifting.

## What is an Ontology?

An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge that defines:
- **Entities**: The core objects and concepts in your data
- **Relationships**: How different entities connect and interact
- **Properties**: Attributes and characteristics that describe entities
- **Rules**: Business logic and constraints that govern your data

## How AstroBee Builds Your Ontology

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data discovery">
    AstroBee scans your connected data sources to identify tables, columns, and data patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Relationship mapping">
    AI analyzes data relationships, foreign keys, and usage patterns to understand connections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Semantic understanding">
    Natural language processing interprets column names, data types, and business context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous learning">
    The ontology evolves as you ask questions and provide feedback, becoming more accurate over time
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

### Automatic Entity Recognition
- **Smart detection**: Identifies business entities like customers, products, orders, and transactions
- **Context awareness**: Understands industry-specific terminology and concepts
- **Relationship inference**: Automatically maps how entities relate to each other

### Dynamic Schema Evolution
- **Real-time updates**: Ontology adapts as your data structure changes
- **Version control**: Track ontology changes over time
- **Conflict resolution**: Handles schema conflicts intelligently

### Business Context Integration
- **Domain knowledge**: Incorporates business rules and domain expertise
- **Metadata enrichment**: Enhances raw data with meaningful descriptions
- **Validation rules**: Ensures data quality and consistency

## Ontology Visualization

AstroBee provides intuitive visualizations of your data ontology:

- **Entity relationship diagrams**: Visual maps showing how your data connects
- **Hierarchy views**: Understand data hierarchies and parent-child relationships  
- **Interactive exploration**: Click through entities to explore connections
- **Search and filter**: Quickly find specific entities or relationships

## Working with Your Ontology

### Viewing Entities
Access the ontology viewer to explore all discovered entities in your data ecosystem.

```bash
# Example entities AstroBee might discover
- Customer
  - Properties: ID, Name, Email, Registration Date
  - Relationships: Places Orders, Has Preferences
  
- Product  
  - Properties: SKU, Name, Price, Category
  - Relationships: Ordered by Customers, Belongs to Category
  
- Order
  - Properties: Order ID, Date, Total Amount
  - Relationships: Placed by Customer, Contains Products
```

### Customizing Definitions
While AstroBee builds your ontology automatically, you can refine and customize:

- **Entity descriptions**: Add business context and definitions
- **Relationship labels**: Clarify how entities connect
- **Property meanings**: Explain what data fields represent
- **Business rules**: Define constraints and validation logic

### Teaching AstroBee
Help improve your ontology by:

- **Correcting misunderstandings**: Provide feedback when AI makes incorrect assumptions
- **Adding context**: Share domain knowledge and business rules
- **Confirming relationships**: Validate discovered entity connections
- **Expanding definitions**: Add missing entities or properties

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start small**: Begin with a few key data sources and let AstroBee build understanding gradually.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Provide feedback**: The more you interact with and correct AstroBee, the better your ontology becomes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Regular review**: Periodically review the ontology to ensure it matches your evolving business needs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Data quality**: Ensure your source data is clean and well-structured for best ontology results.
</Warning>

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Source Integration
- **Cross-system mapping**: Connect entities across different data sources
- **Duplicate detection**: Identify and merge duplicate entities
- **Canonical models**: Create unified views of entities from multiple systems

### Temporal Ontology
- **Historical tracking**: Understand how your data model evolves over time
- **Version management**: Access previous versions of your ontology
- **Change impact analysis**: See how modifications affect dependent entities

### Collaboration Features
- **Team annotations**: Multiple users can contribute to ontology development
- **Review workflows**: Approve ontology changes through structured processes
- **Knowledge sharing**: Export and share ontology insights across teams

## Getting Started

Ready to let AI build your ontology? Here's how to begin:

## Next Steps

Once your ontology is built, you can:
- [Ask natural language questions](/features/ask) about your data
- [Explore data relationships](/guides/data-exploration) 
- [Set up automated monitoring](/guides/data-monitoring)
- [Create custom dashboards](/guides/dashboards)

Your AI-powered ontology is the foundation that makes all other AstroBee features possible. The better your ontology, the more accurate and insightful your data interactions become.
